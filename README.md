Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling
This project analyzes sentiment in text data.

Sentiment Analysis:
Logistic Regression: Simple, efficient binary sentiment classifier.
LSTM: Deep learning model for capturing complex sequential patterns in text for nuanced sentiment analysis.
Topic Modeling:
LDA: Discovers underlying topics within the text data.
Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare text data (e.g., remove stop words, create features).
Sentiment Analysis:
Train and evaluate Logistic Regression and LSTM models.
Topic Modeling:
Apply LDA to identify and visualize dominant topics.
Technologies:

Python: Programming language.
Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLTK/spaCy, gensim.
Project Structure:

data/: Stores datasets.
src/: Contains Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, evaluation, etc.
models/: Stores trained models.
results/: Stores output files (e.g., reports, visualizations).
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis and model development.
To Run:

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
Run LDA for topic modeling.
